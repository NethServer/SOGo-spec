# Build Sogo RPMs

sogo doesn't have a stable repository for free, you need to go to the nightly repository. Here a way to build your own sogo rpm

First clone the sogo spec

  `git clone https://github.com/markVnl/SOGo-spec.git`
  
Then inside adjust which version of the rpm you want, for that you can look http://packages.inverse.ca/SOGo/nightly/3/rhel/7/x86_64/RPMS/ in the nightly repo or https://sogo.nu/download.html in the web page. This is an https://github.com/stephdl/SOGo-spec/commit/5fcf04b0f7e73a79e0567d533597d3da2640e021 example 

Now go to build sogo build dependencies. You have to install nethserver-mock(one simple way, or add separatly all needed rpms)

  `dist=ns7 mockcfg=epel-7-x86_64 make-rpms libwbxml.spec`

  `dist=ns7 mockcfg=epel-7-x86_64 make-rpms sope.spec`

Once done we need to create a local repository because sogo needs some build dependencies you built  

* sope49-appserver-devel-4.9-20161202_324.ns7.x86_64
* sope49-core-devel-4.9-20161202_324.ns7.x86_64
* sope49-ldap-devel-4.9-20161202_324.ns7.x86_64
* sope49-mime-devel-4.9-20161202_324.ns7.x86_64
* sope49-xml-devel-4.9-20161202_324.ns7.x86_64
* sope49-gdl1-devel-4.9-20161202_324.ns7.x86_64
* sope49-sbjson-devel-2.3.1-20161202_324.ns7.x86_64
* libwbxml-devel-0.11.2-3.ns7.x86_64

Therefore you must create a local repository where your files are. For example

  `sudo vim /etc/mock/nethserver-7-x86_64.cfg`

modify accordingly where your files are and paste 

  [sogo]
  name=sogo
  baseurl=file:///home/lsd/dev/git_work/SOGo-spec

Obviously, this modification must be done on all mock architectures. For initiating your local repository (install first createrepo)

  `createrepo /home/lsd/dev/git_work/SOGo-spec`

Now you can build by

  `dist=ns7 mockcfg=nethserver-7-x86_64 make-rpms sogo.spec`

to push to nethforge-testing

`rm -rf libwbxml*.rpm *devel*.rpm`

upload to nethforge-testing or nethforge

`ns-upload  stephdl@packages.nethserver.org:nscom/7.6.1810/nethforge-testing sogo*.rpm sope*.rpm`

PS: if you have the error 'Couldn't read packet: Connection reset by peer' you could try to accept the certificate first

  sftp stephdl@packages.nethserver.org

enjoy :)
